                <h2>What did you learn today?</h2>
                <p>We learned about colour theory and looked into UXlaws and how we can use them in our project. </p>
                <h2>What was new / interesting?</h2>
                <p>Seeing how colours can make such a dramatic change to the look/feel and emotion of a website was interesting. And different techniques that can be used to create hierachy. UXlaws are a series of principles which are widely accepted and can be used to help make design decisions.</p>
                <h2>How can it be applied in web design?</h2>
                <p>Colour theory can be utilised through good colour contrast to create visual hierachy. Avoiding low contrast is very important as you can lose the attention on certain elements.</p>
                <h2>How does it influence you as a web-designer?</h2>
                <p>When designing I am going to make sure the most important elements have the highest level of contrast to create an effective hierachy.</p>
