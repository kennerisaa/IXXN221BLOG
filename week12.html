                <h2>What did you learn today?</h2>
                <p>Reflecting on the course.</p>
                <h2>What was new / interesting?</h2>
                <p> Throughout this course I have learned about a myriad of techniques and overall just became far more familiar with a typical webdesign process, most things have been detailed throughout this blog which will be useful to come back to.
                </p>
                <h2>How can it be applied in web design?</h2>
                <p>By strongly considering the principles I have learned in this course I feel like I have a solid base to refine my web-design skills. One of the things I have found most important is learning the step by step process of understanding user goals/mapping, wireframing lofi, considering aesthetics with my hifi wire franes, prototyping and implementing in css etc. These steps ensure a well thought out and executed product.</p>
                <h2>How does it influence you as a web-designer?</h2>
                <p>Also learning the basics of coding websites has made me feel much more comfortable about potentially speaking to developers in the future and I feel like this makes me a far more well rounded designer. This will definitely influence my designing. </p>
