                <h2>What did you learn today?</h2>
                <p>We progressed into assignment 2-2, and looked into the basics of editorX</p>
                <h2>What was new / interesting?</h2>
                <p> Learning the differences between and CMS and coding a website were new ideas to me. We also looked into the different CMS's and their pros and cons.
                </p>
                <h2>How can it be applied in web design?</h2>
                <p>Choosing the right CMS is important so you I can end up with the most suitable end product. The reccomended CMS's were EditorX, Webflow and Squarespace. We also learned the basics of EditorX. This was a learning curve as I have never used a responsive online webdesign platform and am used to something more stable like figma.</p>
                <h2>How does it influence you as a web-designer?</h2>
                <p>As I am new to CMS's, I decided the best CMS for my project 2-2 was editorX as it is user friendly and is very design first.</p>
