                <h2>What did you learn today?</h2>
                <p>An EditorX fundamentals tutorial and also experimenting with starting to implement my website with CMS</p>
                <h2>What was new / interesting?</h2>
                <p> Learning how to best implement my content, I found using the grid and layouting tools to help alot.
                </p>
                <h2>How can it be applied in web design?</h2>
                <p>These techniques made it much easier to accurately reflect my prototype across devices. Especially within my gallery page which I wanted to have 3 columns on desktop, 2 on tablet, and 1 on mobile.</p>
                <h2>How does it influence you as a web-designer?</h2>
                <p>Learning to use these tools and understanding the process has influenced the way I think about web-design. Many websites I vist now I notice use a CMS and this is something I wouldn't have noticed before. Also it has helped me to further understand the importance of responsive web-design.</p>
