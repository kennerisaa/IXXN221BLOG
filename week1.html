                <h2>What did you learn today?</h2>
                <p>I learnt how to setup a html page, write different headings/paragraph text and display images.</p>
                <h2>What was new / interesting?</h2>
                <p>Being introduced to HTML code was a big learning curve as I have done minimal coding in the past. Slowly starting to understand different parts of the language was very interesting.</p>
                <h2>How can it be applied in web design?</h2>
                <p>Having technical knowledge of how wesbites are developed will help with interface design as you can more clearly communicate ideas with the developer. </p>
                <h2>How does it influence you as a web-designer?</h2>
                <p>It would influence me to make design decisions with an overall better understanding of web-design from start to finish.</p>
