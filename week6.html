                <h2>What did you learn today?</h2>
                <p>We finished up our project 1 presentations and looked into the criteria of the next project.</p>
                <h2>What was new / interesting?</h2>
                <p>We looked into all the steps of project 2 and the required output. It is exciting putting so much thought into a website to create something you will be proud of.</p>
                <h2>How can it be applied in web design?</h2>
                <p>Seeing the process of going from lofi wireframes to hifi wireframes to finally protoyping was very interesting. These steps are useful as they force you to make very considered design decisions.</p>
                <h2>How does it influence you as a web-designer?</h2>
                <p>This influences me to think more deeply about my designs to create the best product for project 2.</p>
