                <h2>What did you learn today?</h2>
                <p>We looked into planning user journeys, and flexbox within CSS.</p>
                <h2>What was new / interesting?</h2>
                <p>Flexbox was a new concept for me to learn, it allows you to order/ lay elements out within a container in a myriad of ways. It is also useful for responsive web-design.</p>
                <h2>How can it be applied in web design?</h2>
                <p>We looked into user-flows and customer journey maps (CJM). These are effective tools to provide an optimal experience throughout the entire time a user is on a website so there are no poor areas of customer experience.</p>
                <h2>How does it influence you as a web-designer?</h2>
                <p>Customer journey maps and userflows will influence the way I see and design the overall experience of a website.</p>
