                <h2>What did you learn today?</h2>
                <p>We looked into user goals and CSS Box Models.</p>
                <h2>What was new / interesting?</h2>
                <p>We learned how to create and link CSS files which allowed us to link html elements and stylize them (resizing, padding, margins etc). We also learnt that is important to 'keep asking why' in order to gain a deeper understanding of our users. We looked into important user </p>
                <h2>How can it be applied in web design?</h2>
                <p>User goals help us to further understand the users perspective which allows us to create a website best fit for them. One of the ways we learned how to examine users goals was through a venn diagram, with design goals and users goals on either side. Inside the overlap was shared goals. This gives designers direction on mutually beneficial areas to focus our efforts on.</p>
                <h2>How does it influence you as a web-designer?</h2>
                <p>These users goals should drive the direction of the design as the user is typically the most important stakeholder.</p>
